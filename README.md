 MPA - Marine Protected Areas - spatial area designated as protected; no fishing allowed
 SPOT satellite tags (Smart Porition & Temperature Transmitting Tags)
 
# 2.4.16#
### Coral
  * Animate process of coral gardening
  * How the nursery works
  * Effects/values of coral, effects of climate changes
  * What is a coral/how does it grow? They are animals
 
### Tiger Shark, Acoustic Tracking
  * We know little about sharks at night
  * Surgical implant of AA-battery-sized acoustic tag.
  * As sharks swim around, they ping ID#, date, time
  * A hydrophone, or listening station will sit for 5-10 years to detect ~500m pings 
 
  Relationship between tourism and sharks.
  Sharks are worth more alive than dead
 
  White shark predatory hunting
  
# 2.9.16#
###Four topics
   * Coral
   * Shark hunting behavior
   * Shark tagging 
   * Shark acoustic tracking
 
 Put in writing the ideas I want to create topic about.
 These are the things I would like to include, animate etc.
 Create a Word document and try to share them all 
 
 In addition to the Dropbox stuff, Neil's website has a bunch of info
 and so does the syllabus (links)
 
 Deadline is next thursday
 
# 2.18.16#
  * Coral timelapse showing a dot for restored coral over time (Neil can get this data)
  * Show how coral fight and feed
  * Climate change is threatening coral reefs; people make a difference
  * There is interest in a macro-vision showing close-ups of coral and related species
    *  What is a coral how does it behave
    * What are ecosystems service
    * Threats to coral
    * Restoration
 
### Things to model###
 * Coral
 * Surrounding environment/scene (MODEL THIS LATER)
 * Species that interact with coral; fishes and crabs
 * Damsel fish
 * Urchins
 * Algeae 

I should develop a storyboard for my own section - I should have index cards for the storyboard that can be moved and stuff

http://sharkresearch.rsmas.miami.edu/research/projects/coral-restoration

We will have a storyboard session on Mar 1 (no class on the 3rd)

* HEAD 1 - Need pictures of healthy vs non-healthy (the same one) - so that we can show both over time with the slider
* HEAD 2 - Need pictures of coral health at different temperatures
* Two types of dynamite fish - developing country people will throw dynamite; dead fish rise to surface. Cyanide fishing also (perhaps put this in overfishing)

## OVERFISHING
 + Removal of herbivorous fish - either directly, or fishing the fishes that consume the fish that eat the herbivorous fish
 + Cyanide fishing - In dev. countries, they put some cyanide in the corals to stun/kill fish. However, it kills corals
 + Dynamite fishing - Intended for the fish (developing countries), but dynamite kills the corals.
 + Fishing gear left on corals (e.g., nets getting tangled in corals) - also 'dredging' - bulldozing over corals

## Pollution
 + Sugar canes etc. When it rains, runoff nutrients get into the water
 + This causes an increase in algae. The algae blooms (red tide) can smother the corals. The algae also reduce light
 + Pollution fosters spread of disease among corals. 
 + Sunscreen washes off from swimmers and can hurt corals
 + It is believed that coral diseases are driven by humans (e.g., flushing toilets releasing waste into the water)
     
## Climate Change
 + Increase in temperature puts the corals past their thresholds 
 + Increasing CO2 - not only makes things warmer (greenhouse gases), but the CO2 gets absorbed into the ocean making it more acidic. More acidic water dissolves calcium carbonate - the substance from which the corals make their skeletons
 + It is thought that the spread/severity of disease is exacerbated by climate change, and can make the water conditions more favorable for algae.

## DESTRUCTION
+ Coral mining (making jewelry etc.). Corals are also removed to put in aquariums.
+ Boats colliding with corals
+ "Grounding" - hitting the coral reef and breaking it
+ Irresponsible divers/snorkels stomping on corals
+ Storms/stormsurge can cause corals to break (esp. in shallow water. This is indirectly linked to climate change)
+ Sometimes while near shallow water, they might want to put in a restaurant or cruise ships; they will dredge through a channel.
