# TOPICS

* HEAD 1 - Need pictures of healthy vs non-healthy (the same one) - so that we can show both over time with the slider
* HEAD 2 - Need pictures of coral health at different temperatures
* Two types of dynamite fish - developing country people will throw dynamite; dead fish rise to surface. Cyanide fishing also (perhaps put this in overfishing)

## OVERFISHING
 + Removal of herbivorous fish - either directly, or fishing the fishes that consume the fish that eat the herbivorous fish
 + Cyanide fishing - In dev. countries, they put some cyanide in the corals to stun/kill fish. However, it kills corals
 + Dynamite fishing - Intended for the fish (developing countries), but dynamite kills the corals.
 + Fishing gear left on corals (e.g., nets getting tangled in corals) - also 'dredging' - bulldozing over corals

## POLLUTION
 + Sugar canes etc. When it rains, runoff nutrients get into the water
 + This causes an increase in algae. The algae blooms (red tide) can smother the corals. The algae also reduce light
 + Pollution fosters spread of disease among corals. 
 + Sunscreen washes off from swimmers and can hurt corals
 + It is believed that coral diseases are driven by humans (e.g., flushing toilets releasing waste into the water)
     
## CLIMATE CHANGE
 + Increase in temperature puts the corals past their thresholds 
 + Increasing CO2 - not only makes things warmer (greenhouse gases), but the CO2 gets absorbed into the ocean making it more acidic. More acidic water dissolves calcium carbonate - the substance from which the corals make their skeletons
 + It is thought that the spread/severity of disease is exacerbated by climate change, and can make the water conditions more favorable for algae.

## DESTRUCTION
+ Coral mining (making jewelry etc.). Corals are also removed to put in aquariums.
+ Boats colliding with corals
+ "Grounding" - hitting the coral reef and breaking it
+ Irresponsible divers/snorkels stomping on corals
+ Storms/stormsurge can cause corals to break (esp. in shallow water. This is indirectly linked to climate change)
+ Sometimes while near shallow water, they might want to put in a restaurant or cruise ships; they will dredge through a channel.
